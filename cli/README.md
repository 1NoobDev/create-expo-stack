## Description

This CLI tool is designed to help you get started with React Native and Expo as quickly as possible. The CLI options allow you to configure your project with Typescript, file-based routing with Expo Router, configuration-based navigation via React-Navigation, styling with NativeWind, Restyle, StyleSheets, or Tamagui and authentication via Supabase or Firebase.

You can also use flags such as `--noInstall`, `--noGit`, and `--default` in order to customize your project. The CLI will attempt to automatically determine your package manager of choice but you can also pass in your preferred package manager via `--npm`, `--yarn`, `--pnpm`, or `--bun`. Roadmap coming soon...

## Usage

To get started, use npx to run the CLI tool. You will be prompted to opt into the features you want to use.

`npx create-expo-stack`

## Tech Stack for the templates

Currently, all of the [templates](https://github.com/danstepanov/create-expo-stack/tree/main/cli/src/templates) use the same versions of the following libraries. Not all of the templates include all of the libraries, but they are all available for use.

Each project is generated based on the results of the CLI, on a per-file basis. This approach makes this CLI extremely extendable and easy to use. Common files to all generated projects are stored in the [base template folder](https://github.com/danstepanov/create-expo-stack/tree/main/cli/src/templates/base) while files pertaining to additional packages are stored in the [packages template folder](https://github.com/danstepanov/create-expo-stack/tree/main/cli/src/templates/packages). Beyond adding files, this project makes use of [EJS](https://ejs.co/) in order to manipulate existing files as necessary.
